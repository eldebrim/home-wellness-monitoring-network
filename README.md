# Home Wellness Monitoring Network
 
## Overview
Develop a network of identical devices that keep track of positive activities through a usable interface.
Examples of activities to be tracked include taking medication, performing
exercise, and eating healthy food. The activities will be viewable through an online portal.
The portal will allow users to create custom activities so they can be tracked.

Each directory in this repo is used to store documentation for different blocks, along with the
files necessary to replicate them. A PDF setup guide is also included to explain how each device
is setup after it's manufactured.
